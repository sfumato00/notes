### The fallacy that unnecessarily frequents in discussion

"All my friends do things this way, and their kids are tall. Therefore, this way is good."

"All my friends do things this way, and their kids are tall. Therefore, it must be genetic."

"All my friends do things this way, and their kids are tall. Therefore, it must be genetic. And we can't do anything about it."

If any of the above statement reflect your understanding, please allow me to frame the same logic in an analogy:

Adam is born in a billionare family and his parents have lots of connections and influences.

Bob is born in a homeless family where his parents survive on social welfare. 

Charlie is also born into a poor family just as poor as Bob's.

Growing up, all Adam does is play, he never has to work hard. At 18 years old, he goes to a Ivy league school. At 30 years old, he is a senior director of Google. 

Growing up, Bob has been work extremely hard; with a very high IQ and extraordinary diligence, he is able to secure admission into a Ivy league school. At 40 years old, he becomes a sr director of Google.

Growing up, all Charlie does is play. Graduating from high school, he doesn't even get into communty college. He has no future or perspect.

Of course, the 3 fictional characters are made up. But their growth trajactories are not. To apply the same logics in the argument height growth argument, the argument would look like this:

"All Adam does is play, and he ends up in Ivy League school and sr Director of Google. Therefore, play all day is good."

"All Adam does is play, and he ends up in Ivy League school and sr Director of Google. All Charlie did is play, and he ends up like shit. Therefore, it must be the family's socio-economic statue that determines the outcome."

"All Adam does is play, and he ends up in Ivy League school and sr Director of Google. All Charlie did is play, and he ends up like shit. Therefore, it must be the family's socio-economic statue that determines the outcome. And we don't do anything about it"

Do you see the obsurdity in the these statements? Of course they are because otherwise, Bob's path wouldn't be plausible. The theory is that even though everyone is born with different circumstances that oneself cannot control, there are factors that one can. 

So, if you disagree with me, please explain where I am wrong. But **`All my friends [do this or that]...`** is not an argument for anything.

I understand `I am short. And it is genetic`. I am not trying to change her genetics. I am trying to help her reach **her full potential HOWEVER POOR THAT MAY BE**.

Of course, we can talk about what other people do, but those approches don't **logically** prove or disprove anything.

### If we don't use antedotes as guidance, what can we use?

I don't think we disagree the follows, but still let me lay them out:

We understand the mechanics of toddler's height growth, understand what are the key factors, and optimize toward improving those key factors.

So far, we both agree, the 2 utmost important actionable factors are:
    - Nutrition
    - Sleep

What so far what appear to be non-concensus are:
    - On Nutirtion: what needs to be done to deliver the nutrition, that is, how to make the kid eat.
    - On Sleep: what needs to be done to make the kid sleep.

### Things that work

- Prolonged physical activities
- prolonged running
- prolonged swimming
- prolonged playground
- prolonged scooting etc.

### Things that don't work

Things that I haven't seen any sign that they are effective. I am not saying they are definitely useless; I am saying they might be useless (as a tool to make them eat or sleep better).

- Bath
- Eat snack
- Eat frozen yogurt
- Eat icecream
- Dance together
- Having parties
- Go to themeparks
- 30 min session of swimming classes
- Going to birthday party and having snacks and cakes and juices
- Having fun while eating.

This list can go longer, which is not the point. 

The point is, can we focus the effort on things that we do know that works. Forgive me for being blunt but:
  - Can you take Yara to playground in the morning?
  - What other important affairs kept you busy during the day?

### Things are might be important:

Remember you mentioned that "Parinas told you that she made Dario watch TV while eating so she could get him eat more by feeding him and that you followed it and Nahaul stopped self-feeding ever since"? 

I don't want to blame you for that and I appreciate you for sharing it with me. 

However, I think screen is a slippery slope. So is any other distractions during lunch/dinner. I know we argued about this today. But allow me to revisit the key points:

#### The Thoery

- The kid want to eat because she's hungry.
- If the eating takes too long she is no longer hungry: 
    It makes sense. Consider the following scenario:
        - Your stomach is completely empty for a while.
        - Your brain receives signals from various organs.
        - Your brain kicks in your suvival instinct. You need to do something. 
        - Your brain makes you feel hungry.
        - You eat 2 spoons of rice.
        - Your organs start receiving and processing the 2 spoons of rice.
        - After certain period of time, your brain starts receiving signals from various organs.
        - The brain has no need to continuouly keep the survival instinct up.
        - You no longer feel hungry.
        - Is 2 spoons of rice nutritionally sufficient? No. 

Therefore, in terms of optimizing the amount of food the kid eats, we should naturally want to `Reduce the eating window and increase the amount of the food she eats per minute`.

We also know that when the kid is watching screen, she forgets to chew because she can only focus on one thing at a time. Hence, watching screen prolongs the eating process, reduce the eating speed, does opposite of what we want to achieve according to the above theory.

The screen can also be a placeholder. Any interesting topic would have the same effect, just not as persistent as screen. 

Can we ask ourselves before we do anything: *What exactly does what I am about to do benefits her **where the genes are already poor***? If the answer is no or you don't know, then maybe shutup about the interesting painting you made and save it for later?
